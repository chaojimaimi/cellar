## [0.1.0-alpha] - 2026-09-01

First runnable alpha. Core charge limiting works end-to-end on macOS 26
(verified on Apple Silicon hardware); no GUI yet.

### Added

- **Charge limiting** with configurable upper limit (60–100%) and hold band
  (hysteresis, default 2%): charges to the limit, stops, automatically
  resumes after discharge below the resume threshold.
- **Tahoe control backend** (macOS 26+): single-key `CHTE` control over the
  AppleSMC unified entry (selector 2 + data8 dispatch), hardware-verified
  stop/charge/resume cycle. Write path requires root.
- **Legacy control backend** (pre-26 systems, `CH0B`/`CH0C` dual-key with
  failure compensation) — implemented against public reference
  documentation; not yet verified on real hardware.
- **Runtime backend probe**: CHTE → CH0B detection at daemon startup;
  read-only fallback mode when no control backend is available.
- **Battery monitoring** (read-only, no root required): percent, charge/discharge,
  voltage, signed amperage, temperature, cycle count, design/raw capacities,
  per-cell voltages, FCC, adapter details (watts/voltage/current/name).
- **root LaunchDaemon** with keep-alive on crash, startup reconciliation,
  sleep policy (charging disabled before system sleep — the control key is
  a switch, not a limit, and nothing guards it during sleep), SIGTERM
  restore-to-default, and automatic recovery from transient SMC client
  failures.
- **XPC control interface** over launchd MachServices: `getStatus` /
  `setLimits` / `disable` / `enable`, root-only for mutating commands,
  request validation (type whitelist, command length cap) and per-connection
  rate limiting on rejected mutations.
- **CLI**: `cellar status` · `cellar doctor` (seven-point diagnostic report
  with exit codes for scripting) · `cellar set <limit>` ·
  `cellar enable` / `disable` · `cellar install` / `uninstall`.
- **Conflict awareness**: doctor detects other charging-management helpers
  and daemons on the machine and warns before control operations.
- **Self-verification**: 76-scenario zero-dependency verifier
  (`swift run CellarCoreCheck`) covering the decision matrix exhaustively
  (700+ boundary combinations), packet encoding, XPC message validation,
  policy persistence, and real-device smoke diagnostics.
